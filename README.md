# App Inventor 2 Hack BI Middle School Workshop
App Inventor workshop for middle schoolers during the Bishop Ireton's third Hackathon, Hack BI III.
## Getting Started
1. Go to App Inventor 2 web page: ai2.appinventor.mit.edu
2. Sign in to your account
3. Click "New Project"
4. Click connect > emulator
## Purpose
The main objective of this workshop is to give students a basic understanding of App Inventor 2 so that they can make their own apps at home and use the resources to expand their knowledge of how to create applications. 
## Topics
- How to use a clock component to randomize movement of sprites on a canvas
- How to use a button component to trigger event listeners
- How to change the visual aspect of an app by dragging and dropping components from the palette
- How to initialize a variable and use it to store a value
- How to use sound effects in an app
- How to make image sprites move in a canvas using procedures
- How to create and call a procedure
## Uses
Phone applications (Apps) can be used to solve many real world problems. For example, there are apps that help schedule bus transportation, organize documents(google drive), prevent texting while driving, and other important and useful problems. This workshop will be useful in providing the basic knowledge of App Inventor 2 that will allow students to create basic phone applications that solve real world issues.
## Challenges
- Create a Pause Game button that stops the bomb and ball from moving when it is clicked on
- Create a “bombExplode” procedure that causes an explosion to appear on screen when the bomb is clicked on.
- Make the sprites move to (0,0) and disable the clock if the user clicks on the ball 15 times
- Only allow the user to click on the ball and bomb when the clock is enabled
- Use the App Inventor 2 online book (link on the workshop outline) to learn how tinyDB (tiny database) works and use your knowledge to create a label which displays the highest amount of times the user has clicked on the ball before losing the game (clicking on the bomb.)
